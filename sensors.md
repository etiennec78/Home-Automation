## Gate ⛩️

The entity representing your gate or garage door

This can come from my [ESPHome firmware](ESPHome-Firmwares/Gate) or from any other integration

#### Supported Gate Types ⚙️

There are two main types of gate entities you can use:

1. State-based gates: entities that stay ON while open and OFF when closed
   These are fully compatible with the Automatic Gate blueprint

2. Pulse-triggered gates: entities that briefly turn ON then OFF to send a pulse to the gate motor
   Read the section below for more information

#### Notes for Pulse-Triggered Gates ⚠️

If your gate uses a pulse trigger for all actions, it cannot reliably handle the closing sequence automatically, because it does not know its own position

Sending another pulse while still opening may simply stop the gate instead of closing it

To use such gates:

* Option 1: Disable the closing behavior in the blueprint settings
* Option 2: Use the [ESPHome Gate Firmware](ESPHome-Firmwares/Gate), which supports pulse-triggered gates correctly
* Option 3: If you have three separate pulse triggers (for open / close / stop), you can combine them into a single gate entity using a [state-based template cover](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/#state-based-cover---garage-door)


## GPS location trackers / Persons 🌎

Each GPS device tracker needed to track your position

#### Summary 📝

Less frequent location updates can impact ETA accuracy

## Driving sensors 🚗

Each driving sensor that detects when you start and stop driving

Use Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Bluetooth, or a combination of these

If your vehicle does not support any of these, you can buy a [Bluetooth-to-jack adapter](https://amzn.to/3G0vOCT), a [Bluetooth-to-radio adapter](https://amzn.to/4jVEoRp), or use an [ESP32 emulating a Bluetooth keyboard](./Extra/ESP-Bluetooth-Dummie)

## Bluetooth transmitter 📡

Companion app BLE transmitter lets a scanner automatically close your gate upon leaving

The automation will automatically turn the transmitter off if not needed

#### Setup 🛠️

1. Install through the [companion app](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mobile_app/) settings: Settings > Companion app > Manage sensors > BLE Transmitter
2. Apply the settings from below

| Measured power at 1 meter | - |
| Minor | - |
| Enable transmitter | - |
| Transmit power | - |
| UUID | [Random UUID](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/) |

#### Notes 📌

* Automatic Gate turns on the iBeacon itself with the right settings when needed
* Your Bluetooth transmitter should mark your devices as unavailable after a short time or this will have no effect
* ⚠️ Be aware that placing your BLE transmitter too far from your gate could cause the gate to close on your vehicle if it loses connection


## Bluetooth entities 🔎

Each BLE tracker entity to monitor your distance from the gate while leaving, and close it when you're out of reach

Could be from my [ESPHome firmware](ESPHome-Firmwares/Gate) or any other bluetooth BLE tracker near your gate

Supported types: device_tracker, rssi sensor, distance sensor, bermuda area sensor


## Bluetooth scanner switch ⏻

A switch which can turn on/off your BLE scanner. Not needed if your BLE scanner runs 24/7


## Nearest distance sensor 🤏

Only necessary for [ESPHome firmware](ESPHome-Firmwares/Gate)

Provides the distance of the nearest person to your gate, to open only if someone is close enough

#### Setup 🛠️

1. Install the [Proximity](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/proximity/) integration through the UI: [Settings > Devices & services > Add integration > Proximity](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=proximity)
2. Apply the settings from below
3. Optional: Disable all sensors except `sensor.nearest_distance`
