    # Automatic Gate ⛩️

    ## Description 📝
    **Modular** and **secure** gate automation that **opens your gate** upon leaving or arriving
    Makes managing your gate while driving easier : don't ever touch your screen or remote again
    Have your gate greet you when you arrive home and be ready for you
    Customize the options to tailor the system to your exact needs

    ## Key Features 🌟
    * **Automatic Opening**: Your gate will open automatically when you drive home. No need to press any buttons ! 🏠
    * **Smart Navigation**: Directly open the gate when leaving home, or launch an itinerary when starting from outside 🚀
    * **Multi-User Support**: Manages up to 10 drivers simultaneously 🚗
    * **Collision Prevention**: Ensures the gate doesn't close on anyone arriving or leaving at the same time 🚧
    * **Security & Reliability**:
      * Precise Waze and ETA calculations to have your gate fully open exactly when you arrive home 🎯
      * Real-time position tracking to adjust timing for traffic or if you pass by without entering 📍
      * Car status monitoring to cancel everything if you leave your car ✋
      * Built-in timeouts in case of an internet loss ⏳
      * Maximum entry and leaving time before auto-closing ⌛
      * Notification alerts at each decision of the automation 🚨
      * Manual actions prioritized over the automation, letting you control your gate even while the automation is running ✍️
    * **Customizable Settings**:
      * Auto-close with iBeacon 📡
      * Adjustable notifications 💬
      * Customizable security options 🔒
      * Customizable gate operation timings 🛠️
      * Customizable travel time refresh rate 🔁
      * Multiple gates supported by reusing the blueprint ♻️
