    WORK IN PROGRESS, EXPECT BUGS
    **Modular** and **secure** gate automation that **opens your gate** upon leaving or arriving
    Supports up to 10 users driving **simultaneously**
    Security features including an auto-close timer, alert notifications, timeout detection, aborting on vehicle left, aborting if driven near home without entering, keeping gate open while someone else approaches or leaves home
    Various options such as iBeacon automatic closing, travel time update interval, and custom gate settings

        **"While near home"** allows to monitor if you drive near home without entering to abort the itinerary, or if there are traffic jams near home to open later (recommended)
        **"Only once"** uses the less amount of credits, but could trigger if you come near your house without entering (not recommended)
